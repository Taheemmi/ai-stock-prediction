For stock prediction

The first 3 is for the gathering and cleaning the data.

- Phase 1: Web Scraping
Web Scraping with yfinance:

''' Use yfinance to download historical stock prices for each ticker.
Save the scraped data into CSV files for further processing. '''

- Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing:

''' Load the scraped data from CSV files.
Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, convert data types). '''

- Phase 3: Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering:

''' Create meaningful features from the cleaned data that can be used for training the machine learning model. '''

- Phase 4: Machine Learning Model
Machine Learning Model (Example using LSTM):

''' Choose a suitable machine learning model for time series prediction.
Train the model using the engineered features. '''

- Phase 5: Prediction and Evaluation
Prediction and Evaluation:

''' Use the trained model to predict future stock prices.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.'''
